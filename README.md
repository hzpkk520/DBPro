OBJECTIVE: The objective of this project is to implement and evaluate a secure database service prototype that stores data encrypted in the cloud and allows clients to run aggregate SQL queries over it. To ensure data confidentiality, it is required to use homomorphic encryption schemes, which allow performing addition or multiplication operations over encrypted ciphertexts without the need for decryption while ensuring strong security. In a nutshell, you will write an aggregation User-Defined-Function (UDF) for MySQL that implements the SUM operation over encrypted values.
